Also we Installed MySQL as part as the instillation process for OsTicket. We installed SQL, redist, hedisql,PHP manager and os ticket we ran to virtual machines to configure which took about 15 minutes. mOst of the work was done in windows 10 IIS which prepared me to get osticket running so I can set admins roles and make and answer tickets.
